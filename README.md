# About this Repo

This is the Git repo of the Docker [official image](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/) for [mediawiki](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mediawiki/). See [the Docker Hub page](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mediawiki/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The full readme is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [docker-library/docs/mediawiki](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/mediawiki).

Do not edit the `Dockerfile`s directly. Changes should be made in the `Dockerfile-*.template` files and applied by running `update.py`.
The project is also running `update.py` via a scheduled github action once per day.

## Installation

### You are deploying your application server with Helm

1. Add Patroni as a dependency in your `Chart.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
- name: patroni
    version: 0.0.4
    repository: https://bcgov.github.io/nr-patroni-chart
    # by default, the object created will be named <your-app>-patroni. You can use an alias to override the -patroni suffix
    # Example "alias: postgres" would have "postgres" as the suffix instead.
```

2. Update your application (don't forget to update your helm dependencies with `helm dep up`)

### You are not deploying your application with Helm

If this is your first time using helm, check out the [quickstart guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/). The steps below are similar to the one from the quickstart guide, but specifically for this chart

1. Add Patroni Chart repository to Helm

```sh
$ helm repo add patroni-chart https://bcgov.github.io/nr-patroni-chart
```

Once the repo is added, you can check the available charts with:

```sh
$ helm search repo patroni-chart
NAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION              DESCRIPTION
patroni-chart/patroni   0.1.0           2.0.1-12.4-latest        Highly available elephant herd: HA PostgreSQL c...
```

2. Install an instance of the chart with:

```sh
$ helm install -n my-namespace my-patroni-instance patroni-chart/patroni
NAME: my-patroni-instance
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Feb 28 15:38:32 2022
NAMESPACE: my-namespace
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
```

### Configuration and default behaviour

You can find an exhaustive list of the configurable settings in [charts/patroni/values.yaml](charts/patroni/values.yaml).

#### Accessing the database cluster

This chart creates two services, allowing to access the leader (read/write connection) and replica (read-only connection) pods, respectively. The `postgres` user's password is available in the secret created by this chart under the `superuser-password` key. Note that you should only use the `postgres` user to create the user that will actually be used by your application, as [applications should not use superusers](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#applications-should-not-use-superusers).
